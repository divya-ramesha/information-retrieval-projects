Search Engine: Yahoo
Average Overlap Percentage: 29.3%
Average Spearman's Rank Coefficient: -10.41

* After running 100 queries in our dataset on Yahoo search engine we got 29.3% of overlapping results with reference to Google search engine. 
* With 29.3% of identical results (which is less than 50% overlap), the spearman's rank correlation coefficient is -10.41 for the given dataset. 
* Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is low when observations have dissimilar rank.
* So, from this we can deduce that the positions of these identical results in result list produced a negative spearman coefficient suggesting that the overlapping results are not correlated. 
* Evidently, Yahoo and google search engines are using different weighting and ranking algorithms to produce results for given query.
* Their algorithms consider numerous ranking features with different score for each feature.
